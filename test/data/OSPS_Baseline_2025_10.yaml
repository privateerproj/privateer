      description: |
        The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way 
        for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they
        follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost,
        by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice.
        The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available
        to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which
        FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more
        likely to produce higher-quality secure software.

        The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry,
        government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks.
        It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used
        by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to
        better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity
        efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved.
        Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on
        practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.

        PCI Security Standards are technical and operational requirements
        set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect cardholder
        data. The standards apply to all entities that store, process or transmit
        cardholder data – with requirements for software developers and manufacturers
        of applications and devices used in those transactions. The Council is
        responsible for managing the security standards, while compliance with the
        PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of the Council:
        American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa Inc.
        The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to all entities that store,
        process, and/or transmit cardholder data. It covers technical and operational
        system components included in or connected to cardholder data. If you accept
        or process payment cards, PCI DSS applies to you.

      description: |
        The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental,
        sound, and secure software development practices based on established
        secure software development practice documents from organizations such as
        BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models
        explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in
        the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation.
        Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the
        number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact
        of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and
        address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also,
        because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software
        development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster
        their communications for procurement processes and other management activities.

        The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is
        designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk
        management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding
        and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain
        risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification
        of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although
        individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards
        share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model
        for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain
        risk management program and determining where your organization's existing
        efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain
        risk management initiatives.

        This voluntary Software Security Code of Practice has been developed to
        improve the security and resilience of software that organisations and
        businesses rely on.  
        The Software Security Code of Practice will support software vendors and
        their customers in reducing the likelihood and impact of software supply
        chain attacks and other software resilience incidents. Often, these kinds
        of attacks and disruptions are caused by avoidable weaknesses in software
        development and maintenance practices. The impact of these kinds of incidents
        can also be exacerbated by poor communication between organisations and
        their software suppliers. This Code addresses those issues.

          Configure the project's CI/CD pipelines to assign the lowest available
          permissions to users and services by default, elevating permissions
          only when necessary for specific tasks. In some version control
          systems, this may be possible at the organizational or repository
          level. If not, set permissions at the top level of the pipeline.

          The project MUST prevent the unintentional storage of unencrypted sensitive data, such as secrets and credentials, in the version control system.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
        recommendation: |
          Configure .gitignore or equivalent to exclude files that may contain sensitive information. Use pre-commit hooks and automated scanning tools to detect and prevent the inclusion of sensitive data in commits.

          The project MUST define a policy for managing secrets and credentials used by the project. The policy should include guidelines for storing, accessing, and rotating secrets and credentials.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Document how secrets and credentials are managed and used within the project. This should include details on how secrets are stored (e.g., using a secrets management tool), how access is controlled, and how secrets are rotated or updated. Ensure that sensitive information is not hard-coded in the source code or stored in version control systems.

          include a description of how the project selects, obtains, and tracks
          its dependencies.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          It is recommended to publish this information alongside the project's
          technical & design documentation on a publicly viewable resource such
          as the source code repository, project website, or other channel.

      The project documentation MUST include the roles and responsibilities
      for members of the project.
    objective: |
      Documenting project roles and responsibilities helps project participants,
      potential contributors, and downstream consumers have an accurate
      understanding of who is working on the project and what areas of authority
      they may have.

          platform terms of service.

          It is understood that projects with a lengthy history prior to

      The project MUST enforce a policy for addressing SCA findings.
    objective: |
      Ensure that the project clearly communicates the threshold for remediation
      of SCA findings, including vulnerabilities and license issues in software
      dependencies.
      Ensure that violations of your SCA policy are addressed before software
      is merged as well as before it releases, reducing the risk of compromised
      delivery mechanisms or released software assets that are vulnerable or
      malicious.
