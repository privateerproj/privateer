# Security Policy for Privateer

Version: **v0.1 (2023-08-14)**

## Preface

Privateer currently only supports non-production use cases. But in spite of that, the Privateer Project team places high value on security considerations, and is continuously working on improving it.

## Supported Versions

Until the official v1 release, we will not support any versions prior to the latest minor version. For example, we will add security patches to v0.3 until v0.4 is released. This documentation will be updated with the release of v1.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security related bug in Privateer, we kindly ask you for 
responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze and 
develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability.

We will do our best to react quickly on your inquiry, and to coordinate a fix
and disclosure with you. Sometimes, it might take a little longer for us to
react (e.g. out of office conditions), so please bear with us in these cases.

We will publish security advisories using the
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/privateerproj/privateer/security/advisories)
feature to keep our community well-informed, and will credit you for your
findings (unless you prefer to stay anonymous, of course).
